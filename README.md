# tower-tool

A tool to generate sweet calibration towers for your 3D printer!

Try it out at **[https://kawaii.computer/tower-tool/](https://kawaii.computer/tower-tool/)**!

## Features

Tower Tool can generate towers that adjust these variables:

- Retraction distance.
- Retraction speed.
- Hotend temperature.
- Acceleration.
- Jerk.
- Flow.

Handy dandy test shapes are included for retraction, various edges, overhangs, etc.

### Future Features

I'd like to add these eventually:

- Auto-detect layer height.
- Linear and pressure advance variable.

## Developing

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) so has all the usual scripts provided by it.
